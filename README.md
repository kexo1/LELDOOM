##  More about this game
* I made this game as my final school year work, I had to learn basics of Unity and C# by myself
* Developing this game took approximately half a year
* You can view my trello board [here](https://trello.com/b/rUmtAu4S/leldoom)
* Notice: this game is a simple project of mine, it's never going to be released on any gaming platform
* If you find any problem, solution, or you need help with something, message me at discord: _kexo

## Needs reworking
* Weapons aren't made in scriptable objects, which makes the code a lot messier
* PlayerMovement and Sliding scripts need to be merged into one
* Sliding sometimes bugs out on slopes
* Optimize PlayerMovement script
* Completely rework ceiling detection when player is under something
* Make bunny-hop functions more readable
* Rewrite settings save system, replace Prefs with JSON saving
* Optimize interaction detection
* Rewrite Wave script
* Game isn't optimized, I've tried occlusion culling, batching, GPU instancing, setting static objects - nothing helped, more likely deep Unity issue
